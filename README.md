## Purpose
Lingua was created to provide a easier language learning and flashcard tool than other companies (like Quizlet)

(This project is in progress for the first release)

## Problems
1. Flashcard learners such as Quizlet lock learning and strengthing features behind a **paywall**
2. There is no **Grammar learning** feature for many languages in any other service

## Solutions
